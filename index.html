          The Office is an American television sitcom that aired on NBC from
          March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, lasting nine seasons.[1] It is an
          adaptation of the original BBC series of the same name and was adapted
          for American television by Greg Daniels, a veteran writer for Saturday
          Night Live, King of the Hill, and The Simpsons. It was co-produced by
          Daniels' Deedle-Dee Productions, and Reveille Productions (later Shine
          America), in association with Universal Television. The original
          executive producers were Greg Daniels, Howard Klein, Ben Silverman,
          Ricky Gervais, and Stephen Merchant, with numerous others being
          promoted in later seasons.

          The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the
          Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper
          Company. To simulate the look of an actual documentary, it was filmed
          in a single-camera setup, without a studio audience or a laugh track.
          The series debuted on NBC as a midseason replacement and aired 201
          episodes over the course of its run. The Office initially featured
          Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, and B. J.
          Novak as the main cast; the series experienced numerous changes to its
          ensemble cast during its run. Notable stars outside the original main
          cast include Ed Helms, Mindy Kaling, and Ellie Kemper.
